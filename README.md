Student Registration System
The Student Registration System is a comprehensive application developed using Python's Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) and ReportLab library for generating PDF reports. This system facilitates the seamless registration process for educational institutions by collecting student information through a user-friendly interface and storing it securely in a PDF document.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The system provides an intuitive interface designed to simplify the registration process for both administrators and students.

Data Validation: Robust validation mechanisms ensure the accuracy and completeness of the entered student information, including name, AICTE ID, email, phone number, and college name.
